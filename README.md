## MyVote

Created during one of America's most important election cycles, MyVote aims to make gathering information on voting as easy and simple as possible. MyVote employs a public voter information query API to collect and display information on the election and voting process.

- Pledge your vote on your friend's pages
- Watch as your friends pledge to vote on your page
- Collect badges as more of your friends pledge to vote
- Find your local polling place and search rideshare options to help you get to the polls

_All this and more with MyVote!_
